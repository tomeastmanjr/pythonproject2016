Git Hub Plan
- Tom will create the GitHub MASTER
- The MASTER will be called pythonproject2016
- This is the MASTER (production) address
  * https://github.com/tomeastmanjr/pythonproject2016
- Tom will push a template to the master for all work to start from
- We will all have a local master and a local branch
- Everyone will work from their own branch of the MASTER
  * To create a branch, paste the following, changing my name to yours
    - git checkout -b toms_branch
  * To confirm you are on a new branch
    - git status
  * To double check what branch you are on
    - git branch
  * To switch branches
    - git checkout name_of_branch
- A few times a day we will pull down the online master to our local master
- When you are ready to commit changes
  * pull online master to make sure we are current
    - probable next command is merge toms_branch master
    - deal with the conflicts one by one
    - git commit -m "add your comments here"
    - git push origin master
    - delete old toms_branch
    - create new branch called toms_branch
    - carry on
