What to decide upon
- Who will present what
- Want we want to show
- Whose computer to use
- What we want in the database (must be on the presentation computer)
- Prep a few Q&A responses
  - What we learned
  - What was our favorite part
  - What was the hardest part
  - What surprised us
  - What would we do differently
  - What advice would we give

Sample run through
  - Intro - All
    - Names, group name
  - What our project is - Tom
    - We created the base for a peer to peer lending app
  - What technologies we used - Mo
    - GitHub
    - Git
    - django
    - bootstrap
    - mysql for the diagram
    - balsamiq
    - AWS?
  - Start the Walkthru - Ryan
    - Ryan discuss the tables
  - Run a Q&A - Tom
    - Need a manager for this who fields the questions, either answers them or passes the question off to a particular person (straight call them out, so no hesitancy)
